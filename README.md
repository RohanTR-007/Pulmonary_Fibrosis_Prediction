### Pulmonary Fibrosis Prediction using CNN

This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for predicting pulmonary fibrosis progression. We trained the CNN on a large dataset of chest CT scans to automatically detect and classify patterns indicative of pulmonary fibrosis. Through extensive experimentation and validation, our model achieved high accuracy in predicting the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. The proposed CNN framework demonstrates promising results and could serve as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary fibrosis, potentially improving patient outcomes and treatment strategies.
